# Chapter 8: Vulnerability Scanning
***

Vulnerability Scanning is the process of detecting a known exploit/vulnerability when analyzing a victim. There are automated tools that do this process. They scan all the ports and identify the OS and services running, then, using techniques such as banner grabbing, they try to identify the version of those services and macth them with the signature of the known vulnerabilities. However, is common to have false positives and false negatives using these tools. 

## Nessus

Nessus is one of the most used automatic vulnerability scanners. It was an open source project, but the source was closed. In consequence, some forks of the original source became open source under the name of OpenVAS (or Greenbone). However, Nessus has a free version which we will use to run an automated scan. 

### Installing Nessus

We can install the corresponding package [here](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus). In my case I am going to use the **.deb**. 

```shell
❯ sudo dpkg -i Nessus-10.3.0-debian9_amd64.deb
Selecting previously unselected package nessus.

/var/lib/dpkg/info/nessus.postinst: line 44: deb-systemd-helper: command not found

 - You can start Nessus Scanner by typing /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service
 - Then go to https://FreeRaidr:8834/ to configure your scanner
```

As the output says, we can start the service doing ```sudo systemctl start nessusd.service```: 

```shell
❯ sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
❯ sudo systemctl status nessusd.service

```
Now we can open our browser and go to **https://localhost:8834**. When trying to access this web page, we will have an error indicating an unknown certificate issuer, because its SSL certificate is self-signed. Since we know it is not a dangerous application, we will accept the risk. 

Next step is to choose what type of product we will be using, which will be **Nessus Essentials**.
![nessus_products](/img/posts/2022-07-26-OSCP-8/nessus_essentials.png)

Now we will need to fill the required information to receive an activation code in our email. Once we have it, we will be able to activate the product and create a User Account.
Once the previous steps have been done, nessus will start to download plugins. 

Now we will define our target. Nessus supports different types of scan such as: 
- **Basic Network Scan:** Generic scan with several checks to be used against various target types.
- **Credentialed Patch Audit:** Authenticated (The scanner has access to a user) scan to enumerate missing patches. 
- **Web Application Tests:** Specialized scan for discovering known web vulnerabilities. 
- **Spectre and Meltdown:** Targeted scan for [Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)) and [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)) vulnerabilities 


We are going to click **New Scan** and then **Basic Network Scan**. Now we will need to provide all the required arguments to execute the scan. I downloaded the **Metasploitable VM** machine to have a victim host where we can throw the scan.  

![scan_config](/img/posts/2022-07-26-OSCP-8/scan-config.png)

The **Basic Network Scan** comes with a predefined configuration, however, we may want to change some values. For example, the predefined configuration defines that only the common ports will be scanned, but we want to scan **all** of them. To change this we will go to the **Discovery** tab and change the value of the scan type to **Custom**. This will add new tabs under the discovery tab. We will go to **Port Scanning** and we will see several options to define how we want to do the port scan. 

We will first change the **Port scan range** and put the value **0-65535** (all ports). 

![scan-type](/img/posts/2022-07-26-OSCP-8/all-ports.png)

Now we will click the drop-down menu under the **Save** button and use the **Launch** to throw the scan. 

This might take some time to execute. Since the **Metasploitable** machine has a lot of vulnerabilities on purpose, the scan will find a lot of things to expose. 

Once the scan is completed, we can click on the scan name to show the results. If we click on the IP address we can see the vulnerabilities discovered in that target. We are able to filter the vulnerabilities by severity, exploitability, CVE, etc.

Nessus define some groups where some related vulnerabilities are grouped, but if we want to see all the vulnerabilities on a single page, we can disable this grouping format. The example below shows all the vulnerabilities with the filtered with the **Exploit Available is equal to true** filter. 


![scan-results](/img/posts/2022-07-26-OSCP-8/results.png)

If we want to search for more vulnerabilities inside the host, we want to provide nessus with some credentials to access it. To do this we will do another scan, but this time we are going to select **Credentialed Patch Audit**

We will need to provide again the IP and a name for the scan. However, now we will go to the **Credentials** tab and add the **ssh** credentials. Since I'm using the **metasploitable machine**, the default credentials are **msfadmin:msfadmin**. Since we want to use password authentication we have to select the corresponding method. 

![scan2-config](/img/posts/2022-07-26-OSCP-8/password-config.png)

Now we can launch the attack as we did in the first scan and wait for the results. 

![results-2](/img/posts/2022-07-26-OSCP-8/results2.png)

### Nessus Plugins

By default, Nessus enables a number of plugins when running a default scan, but we can define some other plugins to do a specific scan or search for a specific vulnerability. 
To do this we are going to create a **New Scan** but this time selecting the **Advanced Scan** configuration. Now we will go to the **Plugins** tab and we will see all the enabled plugins. We can disable them using the **Disable All** button. 

If we want to scan for a specific vulnerability, for example the **NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure** we will go to the RPC tab in the left column and several plugins will be displayed on the right column, where we will select the **NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure**, with the ID: **11356**. 

![nfs-plugin](/img/posts/2022-07-26-OSCP-8/nfs.png)

Now we can launch the scan and wait for the results. We can see that it is vulnerable. 
 
![results-3](/img/posts/2022-07-26-OSCP-8/results3.png)

## Using Nmap

Nmap can also scan for vulnerabilities using the Nmap Script Engine (NSE). These scripts are written in Lua. Some scripts can exploit the vulnerability and they may destroy the host, this is why the scripts are categorized as **safe** or **intrusive**. 

If we keep using the Metasploitable machine as an example, we can scan for vulnerabilities using: ```sudo nmap --script vuln 192.168.194.128```

This is a short extract of the huge output: 

```shell
❯ sudo nmap --script vuln 192.168.194.128

|       The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that is
|       triggered when handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges defined with
|       the DHE_EXPORT cipher. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
|       to downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-grade
|       cryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing the attacker
|       to more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with
