# OSCP STUDY WALKTHROUGH
***

Edit: I was studying for the OSCP but I started a new job as a Security Analyst. Since this certification requires a lot of study and time, I decided to stop and invest that time in other certifications more related with my job role. I won't remove the posts because I think that in a future I would like to keep learning about ofensive security.  
Before creating this blog, I already started taking notes using LaTex :) but since it was consuming a lot of time, I decided to continue using md language. That's the reason why the content of the posts won’t start in Chapter 1 (Introduction to Kali Linux), but they start in Chapter 5 (Bash Scripting).

Let's Go!
