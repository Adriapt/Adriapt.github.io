Welcome to my site. I'm Adrià Pagès and I love learning. The purpose of this blog is to centralize all notes, walkthroughs, and summaries that I create so it's easier to locate whatever I need. 

My principal interests are related to **Cybersecurity**  so you are going to find summaries related to whatever I decide to study (Certifications, specific topics or vulnerabilities, etc.)
If anything I write can be profitable and help you understand or do something, I'm glad to have helped. 
Lastly, I would appreciate any suggestions or comments as long as they are constructive, so feel free to contact me (contact information is available onthe left panel). 

Adri :)
