This technique is also important for preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by encoding special characters that could be used in an XSS attack so that they are not executed by the browser.</p><p>Here you can find a list with the more usefull ones:</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Symbol Representation<th>Encoding<tbody><tr><td>” “ (Space)<td>%20<tr><td>“&amp;” (Ampersand)<td>%26<tr><td>”+” (Plus)<td>%2B<tr><td>”,” (Comma)<td>%2C<tr><td>”/” (Forward slash)<td>%2F<tr><td>”:” (Colon)<td>%3A<tr><td>”;” (Semi-colon)<td>%3B<tr><td>”=” (Equals)<td>%3D<tr><td>”?” (Question mark)<td>%3F<tr><td>”@” (At sign)<td>%40<tr><td>”$” (Dollar sign)<td>%24<tr><td>”#” (Pound sign)<td>%23<tr><td>”&lt;” (Less than)<td>%3C<tr><td>”&gt;” (Greater than)<td>%3E<tr><td>”’” (Single quote)<td>%27<tr><td>””” (Double quote)<td>%22</table></div><h1 id="application-monitoring">Application Monitoring</h1><h2 id="firewalls"><span class="mr-2">Firewalls</span><a href="#firewalls" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Firewall Logs keep a lot of usefull data that can be used to detect suspicious behaviour. They keep the connections that have been alowed or denyed, the protocols used, the bandwith usage, NAT/PAT translation, etc. The rules that the firewall will follow for deciding the permitted and denied connections will be defined in the <strong>Access Control List (ACL)</strong></p><p>The format of the logs will be vendor specific:</p><ul><li><strong>iptables</strong> This is a Linux based firewall that uses the syslog file format to store the data.

This is a format used by web servers to record information about requests made to the server, while syslog is a standard used to send log messages from network devices to a centralized log server.</ul><p>When a Firewall is under-resourced and logs can’t be collected fast enough, an attacker could exploit this by sending a lot of thata and overwhelming the firewall, hence the traffic can’t be collected properly nor detect unauthorized access. This is known as a <strong>Blinding Attack</strong></p><h2 id="firewall-configurations"><span class="mr-2">Firewall Configurations</span><a href="#firewall-configurations" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>It is important to study where the Firewall will be placed in the network. However, this will be diffent for each use case.</p><ul><li><strong>Demilitarized Zone DMZ</strong>: If your network has servers that exposes services (like web pages) to the Internet, they are usaly in a independent subnetwork, isolated from the internal network of the company. Since thoose services are exposed to the Internet, are more vulnerable and is important to add a separation between them and your other servers/workstations. This DMZ zone usually has a Firewall facing the internet, allowing trafic related with the services exposedand another one between the DMZ and the internal network, more restrictive.</ul><p><img data-src="/img/posts/2023-01-07-CySA/DMZ.png" alt="DMZ" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>It is also important that the ACLs are processed from top-to-bottom, this means that the most specific rules have to be in the top and the generall ones at the end. Some principles for a good ACL configuration are:</p><ol><li>Block incoming requests from private, loopback and multicast IP address ranges.<li>Block protocols that should only be used locally and not received from the internet, like: ICMP, DHCP, OSPF, SMB.<li>Authorize just known hosts and ports to use IPv6</ol><p>A firewall can <strong>DROP</strong> a packet or <strong>REJECT</strong> it. When the deny rule <strong>REJECTS</strong> the packet, it explicitly sends a response saying that the traffic has been rejected. However <strong>DROPPING</strong> it will just ignore the packet and the sender won’t receive any answer, which will difficult the work (for example, mapping the ports and network) if it is a malicious adversary. Dropping can be used to create a <strong>Black Hole</strong> and avoid DoS and DDoS attacks by sending the traffic to the null0 interface and not sending a response.</p><p>You can also configure your Firewall to send to the <strong>Black Hole</strong> all unused IP addreses within your network, because they should not be used, and if usage is dettected it is unauthorized.</p><p>A <strong>Sinkhole</strong> is like a <strong>Black Hole</strong> but instead of sending the traffic to the null0 interface, it is redirected to another subnet for further investigation.</p><p>Is also important to observe the eggress traffic. A host could have been infected by malware and communicating with the internet (Comanda and Control servers). Best practice for configuring egress traffic are:</p><ol><li>Allow whitelisted apps, ports and destination addresses<li>Restrict DNS lookups to trusted DNS services<li>Block access to known bad IP address ranges (blacklist)<li>Block all internet access from host that don’t use internet</ol><h2 id="proxy-logs"><span class="mr-2">Proxy Logs</span><a href="#proxy-logs" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>A proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and another server (e.g., a web server). It can be a Forward or Reverse proxy, and they can also be transparent and Nontransparent.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Forward Proxy</strong>: A forward proxy is a proxy that is used by a client to access resources on a remote server. The client sends a request to the forward proxy, which then forwards the request to the remote server, and returns the server’s response to the client. Imagine a company that makes all its workstations to go through a proxy before going to the internet. This situation will imply a forward proxy.</p><li><p><strong>Reverse Proxy</strong>: A reverse proxy is a proxy that is used by a server to handle client requests. It is the reverse situation from the forward proxy. Instead of forwarding packets from the clients to the servers, it collects packets received through the internet and redirects to different servers according to the situation.</p></ul><p>A <strong>nontransparent</strong> proxy is the proxy that has to be configured in the client browser, specifying the proxy IP and port (for example Burpsuite). A <strong>transparent</strong> proxy is a type of proxy server that intercepts and forwards requests and responses to the intended destination without the client being aware of it. It is used for caching frequently requested content, blocking certain types of content, translating IP addresses for clients on a private network to access the internet, and requiring authentication for access control. The client does not need to be configured to use it as it operates in a transparent mode.</p><p>Proxy Logs can be analyzed searching for indicators of attack. <img data-src="/img/posts/2023-01-07-CySA/proxy.png" alt="Proxy" data-proofer-ignore></p><h2 id="web-application-firewall-logs-waf"><span class="mr-2">Web Application Firewall Logs (WAF)</span><a href="#web-application-firewall-logs-waf" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security tool that protects web applications from malicious attacks by analyzing incoming traffic and comparing it to predefined rules or patterns. If the traffic matches a known attack, such as SQL injection, XML injection, XSS, DoS, etc. the WAF takes action to block the request. It can be implemented as software or hardware, and can be a standalone solution or part of other security products.</p><p>Usually the WAFs store their logs in JSON format and they contain: - Time of event - Severity of event - URL parameters - HTTP method used - Context for the rule</p><h2 id="intrusion-detection-system-ids"><span class="mr-2">Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</span><a href="#intrusion-detection-system-ids" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>An IDS is a type of security software or hardware that is designed to detect and alert on unauthorized access or malicious activity on a computer network or system.</p><p>IDS systems work by continuously monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns, anomalies, or known malicious activity. They can be set up in two different ways:</p><p><strong>Network-based IDS (NIDS)</strong>: These systems monitor all the traffic that flows through a network, looking for suspicious activity. They are placed at strategic points in the network to monitor traffic from all devices connected to the network.</p><p><strong>Host-based IDS (HIDS)</strong>: These systems monitor the activity on a single host or device, such as a server or a workstation. They are installed on the host itself, and monitor the system logs, process activity, and other data to detect any suspicious activity.</p><p>When an IDS detects suspicious activity, it generates an alert or alarm, which can be used to alert network administrators or trigger an automatic response, such as blocking the offending IP address or shutting down the affected service.</p><h2 id="intrusion-prevention-system-ips"><span class="mr-2">Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</span><a href="#intrusion-prevention-system-ips" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>An IPS is a security technology that is similar to an IDS, but with the added capability to take action to prevent unauthorized access or malicious activity on a computer network or system. The actions that an IPS can take include:</p><ul><li>Blocking traffic from a specific IP address or network<li>Closing a specific network port<li>Quarantining a device on the network<li>Logging off a user</ul><p>An IPS is considered more advanced than an IDS, as it can prevent malicious activity from occurring in real-time, rather than just detecting it and raising an alert. However, it’s important to note that IPS systems, like any other security device, can produce false positives and negatives, so it’s crucial to have a well-configured and fine-tuned system to maximize its effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Snort</strong> is an open-source, free, and widely-used Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) tool. It can be used as both a network-based IDS (NIDS) and a host-based IDS (HIDS) depending on the configuration.</p><p>Snort uses a rule-based language to define what it should look for when scanning network traffic. Each rule is made up of several different parts, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Action</strong>: This is the first part of the rule, and it specifies what action Snort should take when the conditions specified in the rule are met. For example, an action can be “alert”, “log”, “pass”, “activate”, “dynamic” among others.<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: This specifies the protocol that the rule applies to, such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP.<li><strong>Source and destination IP addresses</strong>: These specify the IP addresses that the rule applies to. They can be either a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses.<li><strong>Source and destination ports</strong>: These specify the ports that the rule applies to. They can also be either a specific port or a range of ports.<li><strong>Direction</strong>: This field specifies the direction of the rule, either “-&gt;” (from source to destination) or “&lt;&gt;” (bidirectional).<li><strong>Options</strong>: This field is used to specify additional conditions that Snort should look for, such as specific content in the packet, specific flags set in the packet header, or specific values in the packet payload.<li><strong>Message</strong>: This field is used to specify a message that will be displayed when the rule is triggered.</ul><p>An example of a Snort rule:</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header"> <span data-label-text="Plaintext"><i class="fas fa-code small"></i></span> <button aria-label="copy" data-title-succeed="Copied!"><i class="far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

It is commonly used in wireless networks and wired Ethernet networks to provide a secure connection for devices.</p><p>The 802.1X protocol works by using a supplicant (the device that wants to connect to the network) and an authenticator (a network device such as a switch or wireless access point) to establish a secure connection.</p><p>The basic process for 802.1X authentication is as follows:</p><ol><li>The supplicant (device) attempts to connect to the network.<li>The authenticator (switch or Access Point) receives the connection attempt and sends an EAP-Request/Identity message to the supplicant, requesting the device’s credentials.<li>The supplicant sends an EAP-Response/Identity message containing the device’s credentials (such as username and password) to the authenticator.<li>The authenticator forwards the credentials to an Authentication Server (using RADIUS protocol) to verify the device’s identity.<li>The Authentication Server verifies the credentials and sends an EAP-Response message indicating whether the device is authorized to access the network.<li>If the device is authorized, the authenticator sends an EAP-Success message to the supplicant, allowing the device to access the network.</ol><p>802.1X also supports other types of authentication methods, such as certificate-based authentication and token-based authentication, in addition to the username and password based authentication.</p><p>All the steps above use EAP messages. However, the communication between the Supplicant and the Authenticator uses EAPOL and the communication between the Authenticator and the Authenticatos Server uses RADIUS.</p><p>In summary, <strong>EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)</strong> is a framework that defines a standard way to provide authentication and security for wireless networks, <strong>EAPOL (EAP over LAN)</strong> is a network protocol that is used to carry EAP messages over LANs, and <strong>RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)</strong> is a network protocol that is used to authenticate and authorize users attempting to connect to a network. Together, these protocols provide a flexible and secure way to authenticate and control access to a network using 802.1X.</p><p><img data-src="/img/posts/2023-01-07-CySA/802.1X.png" alt="802.1X" data-proofer-ignore></p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/cysa/'>CySA</a>, <a href='/categories/certifications/'>Certifications</a>, <a href='/categories/blueteam/'>BlueTeam</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=CySA%2B+Preparation+Content+-+Adri%C3%A0+Pag%C3%A8s&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadriapt.github.io%2Fposts%2FCySA%2F" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=CySA%2B+Preparation+Content+-+Adri%C3%A0+Pag%C3%A8s&u=https%3A%2F%2Fadriapt.github.io%2Fposts%2FCySA%2F" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fadriapt.github.io%2Fposts%2FCySA%2F&text=CySA%2B+Preparation+Content+-+Adri%C3%A0+Pag%C3%A8s" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" data-title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/CySA/">CySA+ Preparation Content</a><li><a href="/posts/HTB_Timelapse/">Htb_timelapse</a><li><a href="/posts/wellcome/">Welcome</a><li><a href="/posts/OSCP-Starting/">OSCP-Starting Point</a><li><a href="/posts/OSCP-9/">OSCP-9: Web-based Vulnerabilities</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><div class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/oscp/">OSCP</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/active-directory/">Active_Directory</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/basics/">Basics</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/oscp-bash/">OSCP Bash</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/windows/">Windows</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><div class="panel-heading pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</div><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-9 pl-3 pr-3 pr-xl-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/HTB_Timelapse/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="small" data-ts="1661032800" data-df="ll" > Aug 21, 2022 </em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>Htb_timelapse</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> — title: HTB Timelapse Walktrough author: Adrià date: 2022-07-16 14:10:00 +0800 categories: [HTB] tags: [HTB, Windows, LDAP, SMB] render_with_liquid: false — Scan and Enumeration Let’s start doi...</p></div></div></a></div><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/OSCP-9/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="small" data-ts="1660198200" data-df="ll" > Aug 11, 2022 </em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>OSCP-9: Web-based Vulnerabilities</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Chapter 9: Web-based Vulnerabilities In this chapter we will explain how to identify and exploit the most important web-based vulnerabilities.
