However, almost all the organitzations use Windows systems, so learning how to deal with this workstations is a <strong>must</strong> if you want to do anything related with cybersecurity. For this reason, I put my hands to work as soon as possible and started to learn how Active Directory works. In this post you will find all the basic concepts that can help you build a solid knowledge about AD.</p><h1 id="what-is-ad">What is AD?</h1><hr /><p>Active Directory is a hierarchical structure that allows a centralized management of the organitzation. It has several services like domain services, file shares, group policies, and network devices management. It can be seen as a Read-Only database accessible to all users within the domain, regardless of their privilege level. This means that any user can enumerate most information about the AD and search for misconfigurations to exploit. A user account without privileges can enumerate:</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th> <th> <tbody><tr><td>Domain Computers<td>Domain Users<tr><td>Domain Group information<td>Organizational Units (OUs)<tr><td>Default DOmain Policy<td>Functional Domain Levels<tr><td>Password Policy<td>Group Policy Objects (GPOs)<tr><td>Domain Trusts<td>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</table></div><p>Consequently, there are a lot of vulnerabilities and exploiting tools that can vulnerate a whole AD environment.</p><h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1><hr /><p>Throughout this post I’m going to use some terminologies that will be defined in this section:</p><ul><li><dl><dt><strong>Object</strong><dd>ANY resurce present within an Active Directory environment.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Attributes</strong><dd>Objects inside AD have associated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/attributes-all">attributes</a> that define that object. For example, a computer contains attributes such as hostname and DNS name. All attributes have an associated LDAP name that can be used when performing LDAP queries.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Schema</strong><dd>The AD schema defines the objects that can exist inside the AD and their attributes and stores information about them.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Domain</strong><dd>Logical group of objects. They can be independent or connected to other domains with trust relationships.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Forest</strong><dd>Is a collection of domains. It can also have trust relationships with other forests.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Tree</strong><dd>A tree is the collection of subdomains that begins at a single root domain. A forest can have different trees. All domains in a tree share a standar <strong>Global Catalog</strong> which contains all information about the objects within that tree.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Container</strong><dd>Is a type of object that contains other objects in a defined place within the directory hierarchy.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Leaf</strong><dd>Leafs objects don’t contain other objects</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Global Unique Identifier (GUID)</strong><dd>This identifier is a 128-bit value assigned when a domain user/group is created. This identifier is stored in the <strong>ObjectGUID</strong> attribute. This value never changes. Every single object has a GUID.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Security principals</strong><dd>Anything that the operating system can authenticate (not only users or accounts, but threads and processes too). In AD, security principles are the objects used to manage access to other resources. If we want to control resources localy inside a computer, it’s not a AD task but a Security Accounts Manager (SAM) task.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Security Identifier (SID)</strong><dd>This identifier is used for a security principal or group. Every account, group or process has its unique SID. SIDs are immutable and unique. For example, a security principal name can change but the SID will remain the same. They are used to grant access and check rights. There are <strong>well-wnown</strong> SIDs.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Distinguished Name (DN)</strong><dd>A DN describes the full path to an object inside the AD environment.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Relative Distinguished Name</strong><dd>Is a single component of the DN that identifies the object as unique inside the current level in the naming hiererchy. It is like you can’t hafe two files with the same name in the same directory, but you can have them in diferent directories, where the directory in this example maps to the hierarchy level within the AD, and the filename maps to the object.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>sAMAccountName</strong><dd>It is the user logon name. It has to be a unique value with &lt;= 20 characters.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>userPrincipalName</strong><dd>This attribute is another way to identify users in AD (not mandatory). It has a prefix which is the user account name and a suffix which is the domain name, both separated with “@”.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>FSMO Roles</strong><dd>Flexible Single Master Operation roles (FSMO) allows a DC to have specific responsabilities. They are usefull when there are several DC within the domain. There are five FMOS:</dl><ul><li><strong>Schema Master</strong>: This role manages the read/write copy of the AD schema. Only one per forest.<li><strong>Domain Naming Master</strong>: Manages the domain names.Only one per forest.<li><strong>Relative ID (RID) Master</strong>: Assigns blocks of RIDs to other DC within the domain that can be used for new objects. It ensures that multiple objects doesn’t have the same SID. A domain object SID is equal to the domain SID + RID. Only one per domain.<li><strong>Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator</strong>: The host with this role will be the authoritative DC and responds to authentication requests, password changes and manage GPOs. It also mantains time for a domain.Only one per domain.<li><strong>Infrastructure Master</strong>: Translates GUIDs, SIDs and DNs between domains. Used whenever there are multiple domains within a forest. Only one per domain. The five roles are assigned to the first DC in the forest root domain. When a new domain is created, RID Master, PDC Emulator and Infrastructure Master roles are assigned to the new domain controller.</ul><li><strong>Global Catalog</strong> A GC is a domain controller that has copies of ALL objects in the AD forest (Full copy of the objects belonging to the same domain and partial copy of the ones from other domains). It can perform authentication and object search.<li><dl><dt><strong>Read Only Domain Controller (RODC)</strong><dd>Is a DC that has a Read-Only Active Directory database. They also include a Read Only DNS server.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Replication</strong><dd>Is a concept that happens in AD when objects are updated ant the changes are transfered from one Domain Controller to another. Connections between DC that allow this replication are made by the Knowledge Consistency Checker service.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Service Principal Name (SPN)</strong><dd>A SPN uniquely identifies a service instance. Kerberos protocol uses them to associate a service with a logon account, allowing the client application to request the service without needing the account name.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Group Policy Object</strong><dd>GPO are collections of policy settings. Each one has a GUID that identifies the GPO. It can contain a local file system settings or Active Directory settings that can be applied to users and computer objects.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Access Control List (ACL)</strong><dd>An ACL is the ordered collection of Access Control Entities (ACEs) that apply to an object.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Access Control Entities (ACEs)</strong><dd>An ACE in a ACL identifies a <strong>trustee</strong> (user account, group account, or logon session) and lists all the rights and permisions that are allowed, denied or audited for that <em>*trusteee</em></dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Discretional Access Control List (DACL)</strong><dd>A DACL defines security principles to an object. It contains a list of ACE. If an object doesn’t have a DACL, the system will grant full acces to everyone, but if the DACL exists and it has no ACE, all access will be denied.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>System Access Control Lists (SACL)</strong><dd>They permit the logging (security logs) the access attempts made to a secured object.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)</strong><dd>Is the complete name for a specific computer or host. It is composed with: [hostname].[domain name].[tld]. It can be used to specify an object’s location within the tree hierarchy. It allows to reference hosts without knowing their IP. For example the host <strong>PC01</strong> may have a FQDN like <strong>PC01.EXAMPLECOMPANY.LOCAL</strong>.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Tombstone</strong><dd>It is a container object that holds deleted AD objects. Microsoft recomends a tmbstome lifetime of 180 days. When a object enters the Tombstone container, it looses most of its attributes.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>AD Recycle Bin</strong><dd>If the AD Recycle Bin is enabled, all deleted objects are preserved facilitating the restoration because almost all the attributes are preserved.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>SYSVOL</strong><dd>This folder stores copies of public files in the domain (system policies, GPO settings, logon/logoff scripts, etc..)</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>AdminSDHolder</strong><dd>This object is used to manage ACL for the members of the built-in groups in AD marked as privileged. It has a Security Descriptor that defines the ACLs that members of the protected groups should have. There is a SDProp (SD Propagator) that runs each hour and checks if all the users have the desired ACL.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>dsHeuristics</strong><dd>This attribute is a string value set on the Directory Service object and helps to define <strong>forest-wide</strong> configuration settings. One of this settings is to exclude built-in groups from the Protected Groups list. This will make that when the SDProp is executed, if any changes have been made to that object, they won’t be reverted.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>adminCount</strong><dd>This attribute determines whether the SDProp protects a user. If its <strong>0</strong> or non defined, the user won’t be protected, if it is <strong>“value”</strong>, the user will be prottected. If the value is <strong>1</strong> means that the account may be privileged.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)</strong><dd>ADUC is a GUI used to manage users, groups, computers and contacts within the AD.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>ASDI Edit</strong><dd>It’s also a GUI tool that can manage objects in the AD. It provides more acces than ADUC and it allows to set and delete attributes on an object.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>sIDHistory</strong><dd>This attribute holds previous SIDs that the object was assigned previously. It can be abused allowing an attacker to gain previous privileges that an account had if SID Filtering is not enabled.</dl><li><dl><dt><strong>NTDS.DIT</strong><dd>This file is the “heart” of the AD. It is stored on a Domain Controller (C:\Windows\NTDS) and is a database. It contains information about user groups and group objects, group membership and password hashes for all users of the domain. Moreover, if the setting <strong>Store password with reversible encryption</strong> is enabled, the file will also contain the passwords in cleartext (that have been changed or created after the setting was enabled).</dl></ul><h1 id="ad-structure">AD Structure</h1><hr /><p>AD follows a hierarchical tree structure. At the top of this structure we can find the <strong>forest</strong>, which contains one or more <strong>domains</strong> that can also contain more <strong>subdomains</strong>. A <strong>forest</strong> is the top logical container. “Best Practices” dictate that having a single forest is the simpler and best long-term solution; however, having a mult-forest organitzation can provide an extra layer of security across different domains since a <strong>forest</strong> is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control. Is it possible to create <strong>trust relationships</strong> between two forests that link them, but it can introduce several security issues if they are not administered propperly. Bidirectional trust between two root domains doesn’t imply that subdomains also have this biderectional trust. Trusts can be transitive or not transitive:</p><ul><li><strong>Transitive</strong>: A transitive trust means that the trust will be extended to objects that the child domain also trust.<li><strong>Non-Transitive</strong>: Only the child domain will keep the trust.</ul><p>They can be <strong>one-way</strong> or <strong>two-way (bidirectional)</strong>. In a bidirectional trust users from both domains can acces resources. However, in a one-way trust, only users in a trusted domain can acces the resources in a trusting domain. <strong>The direction of the trust is opposite to the direcction of access</strong> There are several trusts types:</p><ul><li><strong>Parent-child</strong>: Domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain.<li><strong>Cross-link</strong>: A trust between child domains to speed up authentication.<li><strong>External</strong>: This is a non-transitive trust. Its between two separate domains in separate forests that are not related by a forest trust. It uses SID filtering.<li><strong>Tree-root</strong>: Two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree domain. They are created by design,<li><strong>Forest</strong>: Transitive trust between two forest root domains.</ul><p>A <strong>domain</strong> is a structure that cintains objects like users, computers and groups. It has built-in <strong>Organizational Units (OUs)</strong> such as <strong>Domain Controllers, Users and Computers</strong> but new <strong>OUs</strong> can be created. <strong>sub-OUs</strong> can be created to assign different privileges/group policies. Active Directory provides <strong>authorization</strong> and <strong>authentication</strong> within elements inside the same domain.</p><p>Let’s see a basic structure example:</p><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header"> <span data-label-text="Plaintext"><i class="fas fa-code small"></i></span> <button aria-label="copy" data-title-succeed="Copied!"><i class="far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

Kerberos protocol is based on tickets and doesn’t depend on transmitting passwords and usernames. Kerberos protocol needs a Key Distribution Center (KDC) to issue the tickets. Domain Controllers have this KDC and when a user initiates a login request (AS-REQ), the client requests a ticket from the KDC. The request is NTLM encrypted with the user password hash. KDC also has the password so it will be able to decrypt the AS-REQ using it. Then, the KDC will create Ticket Granting Ticket (TGK) and give it to the user. This TGK can be used to request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS), but since the Domain Controlled is the one that issues TGS, user has to send the TGK to the DC along with the service they want to use (encrypted with the associated NTLM password hash). Once the client has the TGS, the service can be used.</p><p>Let’s take a deep look at this protocol with an image:</p><ol><li><dl><dt><strong>Authentication Service Request</strong><dd>This is the first step and is where the client asks to de KDC for the Ticket Granting Ticket. To do this, the client sends the <strong>KRB_AS_REQ</strong> message to the KDC. This message has (among others):</dl><ul><li>An encrypted timestamp (with the user private key) to authenticate the user. This is only necessary if the user requires preauthentication. If the attribute <strong>DONT_REQ_PREAUTH</strong> is set, it won’t be necessary.<li>The username of the authenticated user<li>A nonce Once the KDC recieves this message, it will search to its database the username and obtain the used associated private key (NTLM hash). Once the KDC has the user private key, it will be able to decrypt the Timestamp and validate the user.</ul><li><dl><dt><strong>Authentication Service Response</strong><dd>Now, KDC will build a new message to give a response. This message is the <strong>KRB_AS_REP</strong>. This message has several contents:</dl><ul><li>The Username<li>Encrypted data (encrypted with the user private key) which contains:<ul><li>Session key (this key is a temporal key created with the KDC after the first step).<li>Expiration date of the TGT<li>The user nonce (to prevent reply attacks).</ul><li>The Ticket Granting Ticket (TGK). This ticket is encrypted with a key shared between the AS and the TGS, so the user can’t see the contents of this ticket:<ul><li>Username<li>Session key<li>Expiration date of the TGT<li>PAC (contains the user privileges and other info (SID, groups, etc.)</ul></ul><p>Once the user recieves this message, is able to decrypt the encrypted data and obtain the Session key and the nonce. This will also authenticate the KDC so the user can trust that ticket.</p><li><dl><dt><strong>TGS Request</strong><dd>Since the user has a TGT, it can be used agains the Ticket Granting Server to obtain another ticket (Ticket Grantig Service or TGS). Whenever the user wants to use a service, it will send a <strong>KRB_TGS_REQ</strong> to the Ticket Granting Server. This message has the following content:</dl><ul><li>Encrypted with the session key (remember that the user can retrieve the session key because it was inside the <strong>KRB_AS_REP</strong> message encrypted with its private key):<ul><li>Username<li>Timestamp</ul><li>The TGT (The user can’t see its content but can use the ticket)<li>Service Principal Name of the service requested.<li>A nonce generated by the user.</ul><p>Since the Ticket Granting Server is able to decrypt the TGT and see it’s content (specified at the second step <strong>Authentication Service Response</strong>) it will obtain the session key. The session key allows the decryption of the first message and authenticate the validity of the message checking both timestamps and usernames.</p><li><dl><dt><strong>TGS Response</strong><dd>If the validity of the previous step has been succesfull, the Ticket Granting Server will sent back to the user a <strong>KRB_TGS_REP</strong> message that contains:</dl><ul><li>Username<li>TGS (Encrypted with a key that only the Ticket Granting Server and the service share):<ul><li>Service session key (A key that will be used between the client and the service)<li>Username<li>Expiration date of TGS<li>PAC</ul><li>Encrypted data (with the session key)<ul><li>Service session key<li>Expiration date of the TGS<li>The user nonce.</ul></ul><p>Like the second step, the user will be able to decrypt de data and retrieve the service session key and the nonce, that will validate the message.</p><li><dl><dt><strong>Service Request</strong><dd>Now that the user has decrypted the encrypted data using the session key, the Service session key can be used to craft the new message, the <strong>KRB_AP_REQ</strong>, to the service. This message contains:</dl><ul><li>The TGS (that the user is not able to decrypt)<li>Encrypted data (using the service session key):<ul><li>Username<li>Timestamp</ul></ul><p>The service will be able to decrypt the TGS, obtain the service session key, and decrypt the data in order to check the validity. If it is valid, the server will respond with a <strong>KRB_AP_REP</strong> and the client will be able to use the service.</p></ol><p>Kerberos protocol runs on port 88, so we can locate domain controlers by searching for open port 88.</p><p><img data-src="/img/posts/2022-06-21-Active-Directory/kerberos-protocol.png" alt="Kerberos Protocol" data-proofer-ignore></p><h2 id="dns"><span class="mr-2">DNS</span><a href="#dns" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) uses DNS to facilitate the communication within de domain.

Since the security algorithim has been broken, this hash has been turned off by default since Windows Vista/Server 2008. The passwors that use LM can be maximum 14 charecters long and they are not case sensitive (converted to uppercase before the hash). This makes them relatively easy to crack. If the password is less than 14 characters, it is padded with NULL characters. The 14 characters are splitted in two chunks and encrypted using the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KGS!@#$%</code> creating two 8 byte values.

When a user logs in successfully, the system creates an acces token that describes the security content of a process/thread and the user’s security identity and group membership. Users can be assigned to groups that can contain one or more members. This groups allows an easier management of access controls because they only need to be assigned to the group instead of assigning them to each user. Usually, in the AD each user will have one user account, however some user can have different users (workers with different roles or processes).

Some rights are only for administrative users. Even if we have a domain account, if we are using a <strong>non-elevated</strong> console, the rights will also be very restricted. This is because, by default, Windows systems do not enable all rights to us unless we run the CMD or PowerShell console in an elevated context. This is controlled by the <strong>User Account Control (UAC)</strong>. If we execute the <strong>whoami /priv</strong> in a elevated console we will se several new privileges.</p><h1 id="hardening-measures">Hardening Measures</h1><hr /><p>Since AD is not secure by default, it is important to add some hardening measures to protect the AD.</p><h2 id="laps"><span class="mr-2">LAPS</span><a href="#laps" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The **Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is a free software that provides a centralized management of the local accounts passwords in the AD protected with an ACL.

They can be used for a number of reasons, such as controlling membership in the local administrator’s group on all hosts in the domain by restricting it to just the local Administrator account and Domain Admins and controlling membership in the highly privileged Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups and other key administrative groups. Restricted groups allow an administrator to define the following two properties for security-sensitive (restricted) groups:</p><ul><li>Members<li>Members Of The Members list defines who should and shouldn’t belong to the restricted group. The Member Of list specifies which other groups the restricted group should belong to.</ul><h2 id="limiting-server-roles"><span class="mr-2">Limiting Server Roles</span><a href="#limiting-server-roles" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>It is important not to install additional roles on sensitive hosts, such as installing the Internet Information Server (IIS) role on a Domain Controller.

As stated above, this can be achieved using Restricted Groups. The same goes for Remote Desktop (RDP) rights. If many users can RDP to one or many machines, this increases the risk of sensitive data exposure or potential privilege escalation attacks, leading to further compromise.</p><h1 id="group-policy-in-depth">Group Policy in depth</h1><hr /><h2 id="gpos"><span class="mr-2">GPOs</span><a href="#gpos" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>As mentioned in previous chapters, Group Policy Object is a virtual collection of policy settings that can be applied to user(s) or computer(s). Each GPO has a unique name and unique GUID and they can be linked to multiple containers. Some typical uses of GPOs include:</p><ul><li>Define password policies.<li>Prevent the use of removable media devices<li>Enforcing a screensaver with a password<li>Restricting acces to applications that a standar user may not need (cmd.exe and PowerShell)<li>Enforce logging policies<li>Deploying software across a domain<li>Blocking users from installing unapproved software<li>Disallowing LM hash usage in the domain<li>Runing scripts when computer start/shutdown or when users log in/out to their machine.<li>etc.</ul><p>GPO settings are processed using a hierarchical structure of AD and are applied using the <em>*Order of Precedence</em> rule. This rule defines several levels:</p><ul><li><strong>Local Group Policy:</strong> This policies are defined directly to the host. They will be overwritten for settings at a higher level.<li><strong>Site Policy:</strong> Any policies specific to the Enterprise Site that the host resides in.<li><strong>Domain-wide Policy:</strong> Any settings you wish to have applied across the domain as a whole. For example, setting the password policy complexity level, configuring a Desktop background for all users, and setting a Notice of Use and Consent to Monitor banner at the login screen.<li><strong>Organizational Unit (OU):</strong> These settings would affect users and computers who belong to specific OUs. You would want to place any unique settings here that are role-specific.<li><strong>Any OU Policies nested within other OU’s:</strong> Settings at this level would reflect special permissions for objects within nested OUs.</ul><p>A GPO attached to a specific OU would have precedence over a GPO attached at the domain level because it will be processed last and could run the risk of overriding settings in a GPO higher up in the domain hierarchy. The Default Domain Policy is the default GPO that is automatically created and linked to the domain. It has the highest precedence of all GPOs and is applied by default to all users and computers. The next picture shows the precedence order and how GPO are applied <img data-src="/img/posts/2022-06-21-Active-Directory/precedence.jpg" alt="precedence_order" data-proofer-ignore>.</p><p>When more than one GPO is linked to the same OU, they are processed based on the <strong>Link Order</strong>. The GPO with the lowest Link Order is processed last, or the GPO with link order 1 has the highest precedence, then 2, and 3, and so on. Is it possible to specify the <strong>Enforced</strong> option to enforce settings in a GPO. This means that other policy settings CAN’T override other settings. Is it also possible to apply the <strong>Block Inheritance</strong> at a OU level to avoid aplying policies from higher elements of the precedence level.</p><h2 id="group-policy-refresh-frequency"><span class="mr-2">Group Policy Refresh Frequency</span><a href="#group-policy-refresh-frequency" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Windows performs periodic Group Policy updates, which by default is done every 90 minutes with a randomized offset of +/- 30 minutes for users and computers. The period is only 5 minutes for domain controllers to update by default. When a new GPO is created and linked, it could take up to 2 hours (120 minutes) until the settings take effect. It is possible to change the default refresh interval within Group Policy itself. Furthermore, we can issue the command <strong>gpupdate /force</strong> to start the update process.</p><h2 id="security-considerations-of-gpos"><span class="mr-2">Security Considerations of GPOs</span><a href="#security-considerations-of-gpos" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>When a user has the rights to modify a GPO that applies to an OU where the used is contained, several attacks are possible.
